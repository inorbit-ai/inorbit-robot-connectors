# Config As Code examples

The files in this folder contain example [configuration as code](https://developer.inorbit.ai/docs#summary) objects, useful to unlock the full capabilities of the MiR <> InOrbit Connector. They can be managed through the [InOrbit CLI](https://developer.inorbit.ai/docs#using-the-inorbit-cli).
Please note that the features available on your account will depend on your [InOrbit Edition](https://www.inorbit.ai/pricing). Don't hesitate to contact support@inorbit.ai for more information.
